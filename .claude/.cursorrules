  # Cursor Rules for POS Rubber Shop

## Code Editing Policy

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT edit files unless explicitly requested.**

When the user asks questions or requests explanations:
- ✅ Provide explanations in markdown/chat format
- ✅ Give code examples in chat (using code blocks)
- ✅ Show how to implement something
- ❌ Do NOT automatically edit files
- ❌ Do NOT make changes to the codebase

Only edit files when:
- User explicitly asks "fix this", "update this", "change this"
- User explicitly requests code changes
- User says "implement", "add", "create" (explicit action verbs)

## Communication Style

- When explaining concepts: Use markdown code blocks for examples
- When showing solutions: Provide code snippets in chat, not file edits
- When user asks "how do I...": Explain and show examples, don't implement
- When user asks "can you...": Clarify if they want explanation or implementation

## Previous User Preferences

- User prefers to learn and understand, not just receive solutions
- User wants explanations and examples, not direct code changes
- User will explicitly request when they want files edited
